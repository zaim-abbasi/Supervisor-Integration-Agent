# Recent Work Summary

- Refactored the supervisor demo into a modular FastAPI app under `app/` (server, planner, executor, agent caller, answer synthesis, registry, models, React UI renderer) with a slim `main.py` entrypoint.
- Rebuilt the homepage into a chat-style React UI with multi-turn history, debug switch, loader state, file attachments that clear after send (custom button to avoid browser filename display), auto-scrolling feed, and per-turn agent/intermediate visibility.
- Added lightweight general-query handling: supervisor now answers greetings/date/time locally and returns a generic refusal on abusive text before calling agents.
- Added tasks view: backend proxy to the knowledge base tasks endpoint and a `/tasks` page with card-based task display, linked from the dashboard.
- Enhanced tasks page with client-side sorting (by ID, due date, or execution order) and richer task metadata (order, dependencies, deadlines).
- Task dependency results are now rewritten server-side: when the dependency agent responds, the supervisor fetches task names from the knowledge base and returns a bullet list of execution-order tasks and those with dependencies, instead of raw JSON.
- Documented repository practices in `AGENTS.md` to reflect the new structure and React UI, including dev commands and style expectations.
- Initialized git, added `.gitignore`, merged remote history (README additions) with `--allow-unrelated-histories`, and pushed to `main`.
- Updated `origin` to `https://github.com/Huzaifa-2669/Supervisor-Integration-Agent.git`.
- Kept planner/answer LLM fallbacks so the app runs without OpenAI credentials; agent calls attempt real HTTP and surface structured errors when endpoints/httpx are missing, with tests able to monkeypatch for offline runs; moved agent orbit visualization to `/agents` (fixed rendering there by templating the agent JSON safely).
